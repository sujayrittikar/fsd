<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<h3>A Silent Voice</h3>
<p>
    The tears tormented inside<br/>
    as she tried to stand it all,<br/>
    and even when it was all dark<br/>
    her acceptance and amends stand tall<br/>
</p>
<h3>Into the Wild</h3>
<p>
    The competitive world<br/>
    becomes louder with the age<br/>
    and the freedom succumbs<br/>
    like a heart hit with a bullet<br/>
    so he left the suffocation<br/>
    to live into the nature,<br/>
    real and free, just living through<br/>
</p>
<h3>8 Mile</h3>
<p>
    A life full of problems<br/>
    breaks everything<br/>
    but the ignition from within<br/>
    can take the world by a storm<br/>
